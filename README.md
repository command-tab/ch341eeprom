ch341eeprom
===

A libusb based programming tool for 24Cxx serial EEPROMs using the WinChipHead CH341A IC

This fork adds the ability to specify the value of the part of the I2C address set by the chip select pins using the `--chip-select` argument.

![WinChipHead CH341A based programmer](https://raw.github.com/commandtab/ch341eeprom/master/pics/programmer.jpg)

**Requirements**

* `clang`, `llvm`, and `make` (via Xcode or Xcode Command Line Tools)
* `libusb` (perhaps via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/): `brew install libusb`)

**Compiling**

After installing the necessary tools and libusb, building `ch341eeprom` is as simple as running the included Makefile:

```
make
```

**Usage**

Using `ch341eeprom` is straightforward:

```
Usage:
 -h, --help                  display this text
 -v, --verbose               verbose output
 -d, --debug                 debug output
 -s, --size                  size of EEPROM {24c01|24c02|24c04|24c08|24c16|24c32|24c64|24c128|24c256|24c512|24c1024}
 -e, --erase                 erase EEPROM (fill with 0xff)
 -p, --speed                 i2c speed (low|fast|high) if different than standard which is default
 -c, --chip-select <value>   the part of the i2c address set by the chip select pins (default: 0)
 -w, --write  <filename>     write EEPROM with image from filename
 -r, --read   <filename>     read EEPROM and save image to filename
 -V, --verify <filename>     verify EEPROM contents against image in filename
```

For example:

```
$ ./ch341eeprom -v -s 24c64 -e
